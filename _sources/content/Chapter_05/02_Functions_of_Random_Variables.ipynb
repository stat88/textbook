    "The method above extends to finding the expectation of a function of any number of random variables. That's important because data scientists often want to use functions of random samples to make inferences about unknown quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that our construction of random variables started with the space $\\Omega$ consisting of outcomes of our experiment. We defined a random variable as a numerical function on $\\Omega$. For example, if $X$ is the number of heads in two tosses of coin then we can set $\\Omega = \\{ HH, HT, TH, TT\\}$ and \n",

    "\n",
    "In general, for an outcome $\\omega$ in $\\Omega$, the value of $X$ is $X(\\omega)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps us make precise the idea that a function of a random variable is itself a random variable. For example, let $g$ be the function defined by $g(x) = x^2$. Then $g(X)$ is defined by composing two functions as follows:\n",
    "$ g(X(\\omega)) ~ = ~ (X(\\omega))^2$ for every $\\omega \\in \\Omega$. Thus $g(X)$ is also a function on $\\Omega$ and hence is a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most commonly, we work with multiple random variables defined on the same space. Here is an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose two draws are made at random without replacement from a population that has five elements labeled $ 1, 2, 2, 3, 3 $. Define the following random variables:\n",
