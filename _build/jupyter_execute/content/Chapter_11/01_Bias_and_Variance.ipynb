    "- It's clear from the diagrams at the start of this section that variance and bias are important in assessing how good $T$ is as an estimator. The bias-variance decomposition shows that there is no other aspect of $T$ that contributes to the mean square error.\n",
    "- The MSE, bias, and variance of $T$ all depend on $\\theta$. We typically don't know the parameter $\\theta$, so we can't compute numerical values of these quantities. But we can work with them as functions of $\\theta$. For example, if one estimator has variance $\\theta^2$ and another estimator has variance $2\\theta^2$, then we know that the second one has the higher variance for every value of $\\theta$."
