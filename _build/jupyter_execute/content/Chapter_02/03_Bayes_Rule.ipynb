    "It makes sense to assume $P(A) > 0$, not just because $P(A)$ appears in the denominator but also because if $P(A)$ were 0 then we could not be given the condition that $A$ occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, think of the grey rectangle as the whole space $\\Omega$. The unconditional chances $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ are the areas of the corresponding circles relative to the area of the grey rectangle. \n",

    "![conditional probability](../images/cond_prob.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But once we are given that $A$ occurred, the outcome space is restricted to $A$. Under this condition, the only way $B$ can occur is if the outcome is in the intersection $AB$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, given that $A$ has occurred, the conditional chance of $B$ is the area of the overlap $AB$ relative to the area of $A$. That's what the definition is saying.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have seen many examples where you have quite naturally written down conditional probabilities without using the division rule. In these examples, an experiment had several stages (for example, cards were being dealt one by one) and you were working with conditional probabilities of events at later stages given the results of earlier stages. \n",
    "\n",
    "The division rule helps when the conditioning makes you go backwards in time, for example by giving you the result of a later stage and asking your opinion about what might have happened earlier. \n",
