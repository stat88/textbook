    "Thus for example rolling a six-sided die once is an experiment. You can think of the outcome as an integer in the range 1 through 6, corresponding to the number of spots on the face of the die that appears on the roll.\n",

    "An *event* is a description of the result of the experiment, which could be more broad than just a single outcome. For example, \"the die shows a multiple of 3\" is an event. This event happens if the die shows either 3 or 6.\n",
