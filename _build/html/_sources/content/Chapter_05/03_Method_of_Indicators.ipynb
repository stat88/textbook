    "- When $n$ is large and $p$ is small, we can approximate the binomial $(n, p)$ distribution by the Poisson distribution with parameter $\\mu = np$. Remember that the parameter $\\mu$ of a Poisson random variable is its expectation. You can now see that we construct the approximating Poisson distribution by equating expectations: the expectation $\\mu$ of the approximating Poisson distribution is taken to be equal to $np$, the expectation of the exact binomial distribution. Thus for example in 1000 independent repeated trials with chance $1/1000$ of success on each trial, the distribution of the number of successes is exactly binomial $(1000, 1/1000)$ and approximately Poisson $(1)$.\n",

    "- In the example above, suppose the 65 draws had been made at random *with* replacement instead of without. Then the number of times Californians appeared among the draws would have had the binomial $(65, 30/100)$ distribution, and the expected number of times Californians appeared in the sample would still have been $65 \\times \\frac{30}{100} = 19.5$.
